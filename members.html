        Hello! My name is Ian and I am a Running Start student from North Creek High School. I'm currently a junior and so far love
        the college experience. Although somewhat a novice and lacking in experience, I am passionate about learning and writing
        code. I hope to transfer to UW Seattle and take a computer science major. I am a varsity tennis player and enjoy playing
        League of Legends and Valorant.
